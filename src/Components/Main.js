                My journey to become a Software Engineer started with a desire
                to make my tasks more efficient. I have come to love coding
                becuase of the duality of structure and creativity.

                My past experience is in the Fashion industry, so I enjoy
                building projects that are beautifully designed and
                user-friendly.
              </p>

              <p>
                I recently graduated from the Grace Hopper program at Fullstack
                Academy and I am eager to continue learning and building
                projects.
